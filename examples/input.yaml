# Let's start with the simplest example, which isn't that simple.
citekey1:
  title: A Book
  # A string option below.
  #
  # This raises a HUGE can-of-worms:
  #
  # Can a contributor be an object, a string, OR a list?
  # Or must we choose only one, which necessarily means a list of objects?
  # But that's an awfully heavy-weight solution for many cases.
  #
  # But let's leave that aside for now.
  author: Doe, Jane

  ## Again: an object, string, or a list of objects, or only the last?
