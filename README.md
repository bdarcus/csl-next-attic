# csl-next

This is a very experimental repo that may lead to:

- a completely revamped next-gen CSL
- ideas that could be applied to the existing CSL
- nothing at all

Primary focus so far has been on `csl-next.rnc` and `examples/templates.xml`.

For thoughts, ideas, expressions of interest and offers of help, and questions, please post to [discussions](https://github.com/bdarcus/csl-next/discussions).
